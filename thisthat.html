								<h3>Alcohol Thing</h3>
								<p>Hi guys! Hope everyone is enjoying fall so far. Just got back from my first big girl business trip ever and boy was it a ride. Everything was fine until my female director took me to dinner after a long day of meeting. At that point, I was really tired and was just looking forward to having a good night sleep so I did not want to drink. My boss put up a super concerned face and said “Anne, you’d better grow your alcohol tolerance cuz you’ll need it to move up the ladder”. Guys, you should have seen my reaction. Dumb-founded. Poker-face. I just felt like getting out here. Girls, friendly reminder: You do NOT have to drink to move up the ladder. Have an amazing weekend <3</p>


								<h3>Women Health </h3>
								<p>I am a police officer and as I was on call last night, my period got me terrible pains. I was suffering and asked for a break but my supervisor told me to not be overdramatic. I was so upset and disappointed. This is the profession that my dad followed and I loved and respected so much him and would like to pursue it much further but my unsupportive colleagues are not helping… Would love some words of encouragement from you guys right now.  </p> 

								<h3>Respect in the Work Place </h3>
								<p>Hi ladies! My name is Julie and I am a Junior in college. I recently just started an internship where I am one out of the three female interns in a group of 12 analysts in the summer program. I was assigned to a mentor with three other interns and he assigns us deadlines that we have to meet every week. When we submit our work we are allowed to see each other work and I have noticed there is one male intern that doesn’t put in as much work like the rest of us. Despite this one intern not caring about the work our mentor continuously goes out to lunch with him with other coworkers. What should I do to not be left behind because I am not “one of the bros”?</p>
